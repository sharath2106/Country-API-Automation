# Country-API-Automation

For this project, the link provided to access the services are down. And they are not working since the start of this task. 
So, for execution purposes I've created a new Country API service using Springboot. 

## **Steps to run the tests**

- Clone the repo - https://github.com/sharath2106/SpringBoot-API.git
```sh
# Get into the repo
$  cd SpringBoot-API

# Run Springboot services using maven
$ mvn spring-boot:run

```

- Check for the services up and running in - http://localhost:8080/

- Now, clone the current repo - https://github.com/sharath2106/Country-API-Automation.git

```sh
# Get into the repo
$ cd Country-API-Automation

# Execute tests using maven
$ mvn clean test

```
- Now, the tests are up and running against the API.
